# nm-net-strongest

This project was originally started in Sep 2019, when I was at college. I was
frustrated with the access points dropping out on my Thinkpad, and I decided to
write a (looping) program, that would run upon laptop resume, and connect to
the strongest access point.

It then turned into a bit of a mess, and I was learning a lot about D-Bus and GLib.

It's on GitHub now for posterity, but as I'm no longer at college, I have no need for it.

Cheerio!
